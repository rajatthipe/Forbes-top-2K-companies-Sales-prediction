# Forbes-top-2K-companies-Sales-prediction

This repository contains a simple linear regression model built to predict the sales of companies listed in the Forbes Top 2000. It utilizes a dataset of financial information for these companies to train the model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between various financial metrics (such as profits, assets, market value, etc.) and a company's sales. A linear regression model is employed to establish this relationship and predict sales based on these metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is derived from the Forbes Top 2000 list. It includes features like:

*   **Rank:** The company's rank on the Forbes list.
*   **Company:** The name of the company.
*   **Country:** The company's country of origin.
*   **Sales:** The company's sales (in billions of USD). *(Target Variable)*
*   **Profits:** The company's profits (in billions of USD).
*   **Assets:** The company's assets (in billions of USD).
*   **Market Value:** The company's market value (in billions of USD).

The original dataset source should be cited here if available (e.g., a link to the Forbes website).

## Code

The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **numpy:** For numerical computing.
*   **scikit-learn:** For machine learning, specifically linear regression.
*   **matplotlib/seaborn:** For data visualization.
